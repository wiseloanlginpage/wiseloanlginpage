Check your finances: Before applying for a loan of any kind, check your credit score and credit report for red flags that would prevent you from qualifying for a loan. Additionally, review your budget and consider whether it is the right time to add another debt payment.
Decide how much you borrow: Talk with a contractor or pool manufacturer to get a quote before you start shopping for loans. That way, you can get an idea of how much you need to borrow so you can be more prepared with your loan application.
Consider pre-qualifying: Many personal loan lenders give you the option of pre-qualifying for a loan. Pre-qualification allows you to see whether you will likely qualify and what interest rate you may qualify for without negatively impacting your credit. Pre-qualifying can help you narrow down your list of lenders to those that will offer the best rates.
