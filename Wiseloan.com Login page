Personal loan: A personal loan is an installment loan with a fixed interest rate that you repay over several years. Personal loans are usually unsecured, meaning you don’t need collateral, and are available in amounts as high as $100,000, depending on your lender. However, you’ll usually need a good or excellent credit score to get a competitive interest rate.
Home equity loan: A home equity loan uses your home equity as collateral and is often referred to as a second mortgage. It is structured like a personal loan since they are both installment loans that usually have fixed interest rates.
