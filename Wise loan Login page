A pool is a major purchase that many homeowners can’t afford to pay for out of pocket. As a result, a loan may be necessary to finance this project. However, a pool loan isn’t necessarily good for everyone.

First, a pool loan may be a good idea if you have a strong financial foundation. In other words, a loan may be ideal if you can easily afford the monthly payments and you have emergency savings in case of job loss, necessary repairs, or any other unplanned expense.

On the other hand, if you feel the loan payments would stretch your budget or if you don’t have a financial safety net, you may want to postpone your pool installation and save money. Also, consider whether your credit is strong enough to apply for a large loan. A good or excellent credit score will help you qualify for the best interest and save you money in the long run.
